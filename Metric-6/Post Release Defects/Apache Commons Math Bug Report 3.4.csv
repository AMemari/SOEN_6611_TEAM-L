The getKernel method is protected, thus users may override it to return a different distribution, but the cumulativeProbability method now explicitly checks if the bin kernel is of type ConstantRealDistribution. Either we document this explicitly in the javadoc as a requirements when overriding the method, or we do a check on the variance of the kernel to decide if we have to do interpolation or not.","10/Mar/15 13:36;psteitz;Thanks for reviewing, Thomas.  I did think about checking variance = 0 instead and probably should have done that.  In fact, since it is possible that a non-constant user-supplied kernel can have no support in a bin, the 0/0 computation that led to MATH-1208 could happen even without variance == 0.  So I guess a more robust test is first check if the distribution variance is 0, then check kB > 0.  Thanks again for reviewing.  ",18/Apr/15 09:28;luc;Closing resolved issue as 3.5 has been released.

","26/Feb/15 15:20;erans;That was to be expected, since the ""cost"" is used to control parts of the the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
Now, we must determine _what_ quantity is used inside the algorithm. Was the implementation correct in using the square-root of the chi-square?
If so we can solve the issue by adding a new method ""getChiSquare()"" rather than change the meaning of ""getCost()"" (even though it can be confusing to use ""cost"" to mean the _square-root_ of the objective function).
